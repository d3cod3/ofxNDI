# ofxNDI3

Send receive video frames over the network. Based on work by @thomasgeissl

## Description

ofxNDI is an openframeworks addon to receive and send NDI streams. It extends the ofVideoGrabber class.

## Tested On

Currently only linux and osx libs are added and tested. Theoretically it should work for windows too.

## Troubelshooting

You might need to add the following run script to your build phases in xcode or fix the addon_config.mk and PR.

# Copy libndi.dylib
cp $OF_PATH/addons/ofxNDI/libs/libndi/lib/osx/libndi.dylib $TARGET_BUILD_DIR/$PRODUCT_NAME.app/Contents/MacOS/

cd $TARGET_BUILD_DIR/$PRODUCT_NAME.app/Contents/MacOS/

install_name_tool -change @rpath/libndi.3.dylib @executable_path/libndi.3.dylib $PRODUCT_NAME
